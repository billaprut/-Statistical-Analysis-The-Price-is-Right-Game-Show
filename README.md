# -Statistical-Analysis-The-Price-is-Right-Game-Show

Developed a Python-based simulation for analyzing the "Showcase Showdown" event of the iconic game show "The Price is Right." The project involved creating functions to simulate the game's wheel-spinning mechanics, rules adherence, and win-lose scenarios. The key features included:

1. Simulation of Gameplay: A detailed script to mimic the game's rules where players spin "The Big Wheel" with values ranging from $0.05 to $1.00, aiming to get the closest to $1.00 without exceeding it.

2. Statistical Analysis: The script analyzed various scenarios, including the likelihood of a player getting busted (exceeding $1.00) and the strategic advantage of being the third player in the sequence.

3. Optimization Strategies: Explored different strategies for players, such as adjusting the stop score to optimize the chances of winning and understanding the dynamics of player positioning and its impact on winning probabilities.

4. Insights and Results: The simulation provided insightful data on game dynamics, revealing that the third player often has a strategic advantage. Additionally, it highlighted the relationship between stop score selection and the probability of winning.
